    "The \"Collaborative Chemoinformatics Open Platform\" (CHEMO) course is an autonomous learning platform aimed at students and researchers interested in the development of biocomputing tools, from Python, which is the most widely used programming language. With advances in omic sciences and new technologies, it has become necessary to acquire computer skills applied to science and the management of biological databases.\n",

    "## JupyternoNotebook Overview\n",
    "A jupyter notebook is made up of a title, a toolbar, and cells. The toolbar allows us to save, insert a new cell, cut, copy and paste cells. In addition, it has a section with functions to manipulate the Kernel component, which is the part in charge of executing the code contained in the notebook. In this section we will be able to run the selected cell and move forward, interrupt the kernel, restart the kernel and restart the kernel and run all the cells. For all tutorials we recommend rebooting the kernel, this is done by clicking on the button with an arrow with the return sign. Finally, we have an option in the toolbar for cells that can be of type code and are identified by the In [ ]: label that appears at the beginning of the cell. Another option for the cell is markdown, it is there where we can include comments, images and links using the Markdown language."

    "A variable is a reference to a value in the computer's memory, where different **types of data** can be stored. Values ​​are usually assigned to variable names, an example of this is: `text = \"hello world\"`, `text` is the name of the variable and refers to `hello world` which would be the value of the variable, and in the previous example the operator `=` was used, then the operation that was performed was assignment. This is known as an assignment expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is usually the software developer who assigns a variable name that is easy to remember and use in the program. It is important to know that the name of the variables cannot begin with a number and they are case sensitive, and spaces cannot be included.\n",

    "Apart from the native Python expressions and functionalities known so far throughout the book, there are others that are very relevant and necessary when writing any computer program. And we are talking about **functions**: A function is basically a piece of code that can be reused, that has a name that identifies it, and receives some input parameters **<sup> 4 </sup>**. Functions generally do not always return the same result, they have a behavior based on the values ​​of their arguments.\n",

    "When defining a function, it is important to keep in mind that:\n",

    "1. Have a name that explains at first sight, the result and the operation it performs.\n",
