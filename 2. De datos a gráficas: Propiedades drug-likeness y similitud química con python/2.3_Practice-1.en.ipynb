    "\n",
    "### **Pharmacokinetics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Pharmacokinetics are the study of what happens to a compound in an organism over a period of time<sup> **1** </sup>. It is divide into four steps: **A**bsorption, **D**istribution, **M**etabolism and **E**xcretion (ADME)<sup> **1, 2** </sup> . Some times also is includes **T**oxicology (ADMET) and **L**iberation (LADME).\n",
    "\n",

    "<img src=\"img/ADME-en.jpg\" alt=\"ADME\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Figure 1*. Steps that make up the pharmacokinetics. From: [Somvanshi, Kharat, Jadhav, Thorat & Townley, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-323-85050-6.00007-4)\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Absorption:** It refers to the amount and time it takes for a compound or substance to enter to the systemic circulation from the site of administration. It depends on multiple factors such as the ability of the compound to penetrate the intestinal wall, the solubility of the compound, the gastric emptying time, the chemical stability of the compound in the stomach, among others<sup> **1, 2** </sup>.\n",
    "   * **Distribution:** It refers to how a substance is spread throughout the body. It depends on the diffusion and convection which may be influenced by the polarity, size, or binding abilities of the drug, the fluid status of the patient, or the body habitus of the individual. It is very important to achieve the effective drug concentration in the receptor site because to be effective a medication must reach its designated compartmental destination<sup> **1, 2** </sup>.\n",
    "   * **Metabolism:** It refers to the processing of the drug by the body into subsequent compounds. It can be also to convert a drug  into more water-soluble substances in order to be more easily to excreted or in the case of prodrugs the metabolism is required to convert the drug into active metabolites<sup> **1, 2** </sup>.\n",
    "   * **Excretion:** It refers to the process by which the drug is eliminated from the body. Generally the kidneys are the conduct of excretion by a passive filtration in the glomerulus or secretion in the tubules<sup> **1, 2** </sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lipinski's rule of five:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lipinski's rule of five is one way to screen out compounds with probable absorption problems. This rule states that poor absorption or permeation of a drug is more probable when the chemical structure fulfils two or more of the following criteria<sup> **3** </sup>:\n",
    "1. Molecular weight (MW) is greater than 500.\n",
    "2. The calculated log P value is above 5.\n",
    "3. There are more than 5 hydrogen bond donors (–NH–, –OH).\n",
    "4. The number of hydrogen bond acceptors (–N ¼ , –O–) is greater than 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to know that the rule of five does not definitively categorize all well and poorly absorbed compounds, although it is simple, fast, and provides a reasonable degree of classification."

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "For an investigation of a new drug we want to know if it is really absorbed by the body, if it is able to cross certain barriers to reach his target, how is it metabolized and how is excreted from the body. In this way doctors will have greater flexibility in prescribing and administering medications thus providing greater benefit with less risk and making adjustments as necessary, given the varied physiology and lifestyles of patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to know the absorption of the compounds we will use bioinformatic tools to be able to calculate Lipinski's rule of five and then we will calculate some statistics to plot them and analyze."

Approximately 16% of oral drugs fail to meet at least one of the Ro5 parameters, and 6% fail to meet two or more. To quantify the quality of compounds, the concept of desirability is applied, allowing for the establishment of a quantitative metric called QED (Quantitative Estimation of Drug-likeness). QED values range from zero, indicating the presence of all unfavorable properties, to one, representing a profile with all favorable properties<sup> **4** </sup>."

    "\n",
    "In this practice, we have learned about Lipinski's rule of five as a measure to estimate a compound's oral bioavailability and we have applied the rule on a dataset n order to filter it and discard those compounds that meet two or more of the criteria. Also, we learn dto make simple graphs such as bar graphs that allow us to visualize the data set as a whole or each compound of the data set. In addition, we learned to make scatterplots that allow us to observe the data set against the four criteria of the Lipinski rule. Finally, we build a more complex plot like the radar plot which allows us to compare multiple variables (Lipinski rules) on a single plot."
