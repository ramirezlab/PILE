    "## Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Molecular fingerprints**\n",
    "Molecular fingerprints are essential cheminformatics tools for virtual screening and mapping chemical space. These is a way to describe a molecular structure that can convert a molecular structure into a bit string<sup> **1** </sup>. Each bit corresponds to a predefined molecular feature or environment, where \"1\" represents the presence and \"0\" the absence of a feature. Since molecular fingerprint encodes the structure of a molecule, it is a useful method to describe the structural similarity among the molecules as a molecular descriptor. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Morgan fingerprints**\n",
    "The most popular molecular fingerprint is the Morgan fingerprint that is based on the Morgan algorithm.These algorithmm generated bits correspond to the circular environments of each atom in a molecule and the number of neighboring bonds and atoms to consider is set by the radius, which are predictive of the biological activities of small organic molecules<sup> **2** </sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Molecular similarity measure: Tanimoto coefficient**\n",
    "Two such fingerprints are most commonly compared with the Tanimoto similarity metric. These metric take  a value between 0 and 1, with 1 corresponding to identical fingerprints<sup> **3** </sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/Tanimoto-coefficient-en.jpg\" alt=\"Tanimoto-coefficient\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Clustering**\n",
    "Is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). Compound clustering in pharmaceutical research is often based on chemical or structural similarity between compounds to find groups that share properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are [key steps](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B008045044X001474) in the clustering approach that we will folound:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Data preparation and compound encoding:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The compounds in the input data will be encoded as molecular fingerprints.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**2. Tanimoto similarity (or distance) matrix:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The similarity between two fingerprints is calculated using the Tanimoto coefficient.\n",
    "- Matrix with Tanimoto similarities between all possible molecule/fingerprint pairs (n * n similarity matrix with =number of molecules, upper triangle matrix used only).\n",
    "- Equally, the distances matrix can be calculated (1 - similarity).\n",
    "    \n",
    "**3. Clustering molecules**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The clustering result depends on the threshold chosen by the user:\n",
    "    - The smaller the distance value cut-off, the more similar the compounds are required to belong to one cluster.\n",
    "    - The higher the threshold (distance cutoff), the more molecules are considered as similar, you will have less clusters.\n",
    "    - The lower the threshold, the more small clusters and \"singletons\" appear."
